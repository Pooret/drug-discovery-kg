# Drug Discovery Knowledge Graph Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive knowledge graph for drug discovery by leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs). The knowledge graph will integrate valuable information from various sources, such as scientific literature, patents, and clinical trials data, facilitating more efficient research and reducing costs in the pharmaceutical industry.

The project will involve the following steps:

1. **Raw Data Collection**: Gather relevant text data from multiple sources, including research articles, patents, and clinical trial records.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, preprocess, and normalize the text data to ensure its suitability for subsequent NLP tasks.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Apply NER models to identify relevant entities such as drugs, proteins, diseases, and other biological entities within the text data.

4. **Text Classification**: Classify text segments based on various criteria, such as drug action, drug target, and clinical trial phase, to better understand and categorize the extracted information.

5. **Relation Extraction**: Train and apply relation extraction models using annotated datasets or distant supervision techniques to identify relationships between the entities found during the NER step. The relationships can be of various types, such as drug-target interactions, drug-disease associations, or protein-protein interactions.

6. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Integrate the extracted entities and relationships into a structured knowledge graph. This knowledge graph will serve as a valuable resource for researchers to analyze and mine insights related to drug discovery and development.

7. **Knowledge Graph Analysis**: Evaluate the constructed knowledge graph, identify potential improvements or errors, and iteratively refine it to ensure its accuracy and completeness.

By combining cutting-edge NLP techniques and LLMs, this project aims to create a powerful knowledge graph that captures essential information and connections between various entities in the drug discovery domain. This knowledge graph will ultimately facilitate more efficient research and reduce costs in the pharmaceutical industry.
